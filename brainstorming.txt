Maps of pathing, derive algorithms from that
Pathing by using those with sight. 

Stairs?

Find the specific failures in this system, redefine algorithms
Most people aren't trying to collide, so this may be self solving?

How to guarantee safety?
Should solve itself for major issues such as cars
How so? 
GPS may instruct you to follow the road
sensors stop unnecessary veering in any direction

Are the techniques used for smart cars relevant?

non-blind uses
	aid in spelunking?
	idk, this is most likely irrelevant


Voice feedback?
Applet?
an app on an android device is more reliably connected

point: this is a quality of life device for a small portion of the population
counter: should these people not be afforded the same quality of life for something they cannot control?

point: battery power? how long could a device like this feasibly last?
		what if an individual is left stranded in an area because of a loss of power? 
counter: battery alerts, context based power allocation? motion generating power?

point: how should someone affix this? the main management device?
uhhh to the side of their pants? 
possibly a dual sensor on the chest or pants?

ensuring proper application?

wires between points? 
attach clips? this increases cost

Stress this is only to prove the concept of the system. Final sensor placement is up in the air.

Security is also very important. but that lies outside the scope of this

ofc you need to agree to have your data tracked

depending on the configuration this could also be useful for deaf people for evaluating object outside their fov?
